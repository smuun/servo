# Rust on the Heltec wifi v3 board.

## Dev notes

TODO:
- cartesian -> arm coordinates (math should be correct but unfortunately can't see how to avoid floats)
    - added float lib
    - next: implement coordinates math & test
- slow sweep to target angle
- (very simple) onboard path planning to avoid collisions

Ideas:
- closed loop control of effector position w/ magnetometer
-
